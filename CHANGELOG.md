# Changelog

Operator-facing changes, collected as they merge. The `/release` skill turns the unreleased section into the
tag's release notes.

## Unreleased: 5.0.0

### Upgrading

- **Migrations run inside `service-core` as it starts.** The `flow-service-loader` image and its pre-deploy
  Job are gone; remove them from the deployment and give `service-core` a startup probe that covers the
  migration. One product tag builds three images.
- **Only an empty database or a v3 database can be upgraded.** A v4 database, or one a 5.0 beta migrated,
  is refused at startup. Reset beta databases before upgrading.
- **Encryption keys are two pairs.** `mongo.encrypt.secret`/`mongo.encrypt.salt` now mean the v3 pair, read
  once to decrypt v3's secured settings during the upgrade. `flow.encrypt.secret`/`flow.encrypt.salt` is the
  key v5 encrypts with and is required on every install. Set both before the first start against a v3
  database. (Lands with the AES-GCM settings encryption change, #408.)
- **Before a v3 upgrade, check for users sharing one email.** The migration never deletes an account, so a
  shared email stops startup until it is resolved. See "Upgrading from v3" in the README.

### Changed

- Settings are built from the shipped seed on first start, carrying an upgraded install's own values, so an
  upgraded and a new install have the same settings documents.
- The same indexes are built on every install; the token lookup index is now built on a new install.
- Migrated v3 approver groups are reachable from their workspace again.
